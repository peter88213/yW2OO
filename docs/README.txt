# yW2OO (yWriter-to-OpenOffice)

Converting yWriter's HTML export into a neat OpenOffice Writer document, ready to apply templates and styles.


## General

[yWriter5](http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter5.html) is a free word processor written by Australian author and programmer Simon Haynes. yWriter is very useful to structure and write novels, but it is not intended to bring text into a typographically good shape. So the finished project is to be exported for formatting and typographic fine-tuning e.g. in a powerful office suite. Depending on the target software and the user's standards, this may require several intermediate steps. The yW2OO software package automatizes them for OpenOffice Writer, thus there remains just a minimum of manual work to get a neat and pretty OpenOffice document.


## Features

* Auto-installation: Extract setup files anywhere in your user profile and run "install.bat".
* Easy to use: Just copy "writer.bat" into your yWriter Export folder and run it.
* Provides a document template (A4, Page numbers, Courier New, 30 lines Ã  60 characters maximum) for manual application.


yW2OO cleans up the file "Exported Project.html" generated by yWriter5 for OpenOffice Writer (V 3.x and 4.x). It will automatically
* remove several undesirable tags, such as table and font specification.
* set Chapter headings to "Heading 2".
* set Scene headings to "Heading 4".
* set the first paragraph of each chapter and scene to "Text body" style.
* set all other paragraphs to "First-line indent" style. 
* convert direct formatting ("italic", "bold") into OpenOffice Writer's character styles ("Emphasis", "Strong Emphasis").
* convert en-dashes into em-dashes if spaced (European style).
* convert spaces before en-dashes and ellipses into non-breaking space characters.
* remove empty paragraphs within scenes.
* save the document as "ODT".


## System requirements

* yWriter5 (yW2OO is NOT tested with yWriter6 output!)
* Windows (yW2OO is tested on Vista (32 bit) and Win 10 (64 bit)).
* OpenOffice.org 3.x or Apache OpenOffice 4.x (German or English installation required)
* Java


## Contents

The yW2OO Software comes as self-extracting zipfile containing:
* README.txt: Short description of the software package (English language).
* LIESMICH.txt: Short description of the software package (German language).
* Install.bat: Installation file to put everything at the right place.
* yW2OO.py: A script to be executed automatically before opening the HTML file in OpenOffice Writer.
* yW2OO.oxt: OpenOffice extension containing a required Macro library 
* Manuscript.ott: Document template for optional use
* LICENSE.txt: Terms and conditions.


## Installation

1. Run the self-extracting zipfile "yW2OO-setup.exe" (double click) and choose a folder within your user profile (e.g. "My documents"). A folder "yW2OO_Installation_files" will automatically be created for all content.

2. Move into the "yW2OO_Installation_files" folder and run "Install.bat" (double click). This will copy all needed files to the right place and start Office's Extension Manager. Confirm the installation of the extension "yW2OO.oxt" and close the Extension Manager window.

3. Now you should see a newly generated file "writer.bat". Copy this file into the "Export" subfolder of your yWriter project (DO NOT MOVE -- you might need a copy for every yWriter project).


## Usage

1. Write your novel in yWriter5. Use Italics as you wish for emphasis, inner thoughts, dreams, memories, foreign words and titles (except song titles which must be placed inside quotation marks). Use Bold as you wish for loud cries, Newspaper or poster headlines, acronyms and so on. Use "--" for dashes. space them, if you want European style em-dashes; otherwise you will get US style en-dashes.

2. Let yWriter export your project to <your project folder>\Export\Exported Project.html.

3. You may close the web browser window showing "Exported Project.html". Exit yWriter.

4. Move into the <your project folder>\Export folder.

5. Run "writer.bat" (double click).

6. If everything goes well, OpenOffice Writer will start automatically and show your document as a OpenDocument file named "Exported Project.odt" with a hierarchical structure and with the right styles applied (see "Features").

7. Apply a template (recommended: "Manuscript.ott"). If you are unfamiliar with this, Use the help function or see the [Wiki Page](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Loading_styles_from_a_template_or_document).

8. Have fun editing your nice and neat document.
