[yWriter](http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) is a free word processor written by Australian author and programmer Simon Haynes. yWriter's strengths are structuring novels and controlling the progress during the writing process. With this Python script, you can combine the advantages of yWriter 7 with the advantages of OpenOffice/LibreOffice.


## Features (a Python 3 installation is required)

-   Generate a "standard manuscript" formatted **ODF text document
    (ODT)** from an yWriter 6/7 project.

-   Load yWriter 6/7 chapters and scenes into an OpenDocument file with
    chapter and scene markers for **proof reading** and writing back.

-   Generate a **character list** that can be edited in Office Calc and
    written back to yWriter format.

-   Generate a **location list** that can be edited in Office Calc and
    written back to yWriter format.

-   Generate an **item list** that can be edited in Office Calc and
    written back to yWriter format.

-   Generate an OpenDocument text file containing navigable **cross
    references** , such as scenes per character, characters per tag,
    etc.


With the [pywoo extension for OpenOffice](https://peter88213.github.io/pywoo) and the [yw-cnv extension for LibreOffice](https://peter88213.github.io/yw-cnv), you can write your edited Office documents back to the yWriter project.

    
## Requirements

- Windows.
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org). Python 3.4 or more recent will work. However, Python 3.7 or above is highly recommended.
- [yWriter](http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html).
- An [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) installation.
