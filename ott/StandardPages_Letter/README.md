# StandardPages.ott -- Document template for international customization

## Features

* 8.5" x 11" (US letter) paper size
* 25 lines
* 60 characters/line
* 12 p Courier Prime or, if not installed, Courier New
* Document language: en-US

## Note on the used font

_Courier Prime_ is an open source alternative to the Windows _Courier New_ font with the same metrics. Courier Prime is free and looks way better in print than Courier New, so I recommend highly to install it. You find it zipped in the *Fonts* folder. There is also a _Read me_ file with further informations about the font.

## How to change the language

1. Right-click `StandardPages.ott` and select `open`  (DO NOT DOUBLE CLICK) --> This starts Office Writer to modify the template.
2. `(OpenOffice main menu)` --> `Tools` --> `Language` --> `For all Text`.
3. Select your language.
4. Save document. 

## How to install

Run `Install.bat` in this folder or copy `StandardPages.ott` to your Open/LibreOffice `user\template` directory.
