@summary: Adds scene titles from yWriter's exported "Scene descriptions" file as HTML comments to the pre-processed HTML export file.
OpenOffice shall display these comments e.g. in the Navigator.
This script reads scene titles from "Auto_Descriptions.txt" generated by yWriter (Project-->Export Project-->Scene descriptions).
This script identifies scene beginnings in "Exported Project.html" by the <h6> tag inserted by yW2OO.py postprocessor. 
Exported yWriter scenes must not be empty.

@return: Exit code 
    0 if no error occurred;
    1 if "Exported Project.html" or "Auto_Descriptions.txt" cannot be read or written;
    2 if "Exported Project.html" is not pre-processed or contains no scene;
    3 if "Exported Project.html" and "Auto_Descriptions.txt" contain different numbers of scenes.
@precondition: The file "Exported Project.html" must exist with r/w access in the working directory. It must be pre-processed by yW2OO.py, i.e. each scene begins with a <H6> formatted paragraph.
@precondition: The File "Auto_Descriptions.txt" must exist in the directory just above the working directory. It must match to "Exported Project.html", i.e the number of sceneTitles must be the same.
@postcondition: The file "Exported Project.html" is modified (see summary).
@since: 2019-10-05
@change: v1.1.0 Scene titles are taken from "Auto_Descriptions.txt" instead of "auto_outline.txt". Each scene gets a number.
